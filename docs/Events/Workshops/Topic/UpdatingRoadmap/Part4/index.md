# Updating the Roadmap to Whole Brain Emulation Part 4:
## SUCCESSFUL MIND UPLOADING
## What is Personal Identity and how can it Survive Mind Uploading

 
THIS WORKSHOP HAS CONCLUDED – MANY THANKS TO ALL OF OUR PARTICIPANTS!

The entire workshop is available on our [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuNZLgW-6Xcp6wfyb2Y_Thw).

The workshop included audience participation. Many thanks to all who RSVPed!

The Carboncopies Foundation is continuing the workshop series around updating the 2008 Oxford University manuscript, "Whole Brain Emulation: A Roadmap." In our previous event, "Updating the Roadmap to Whole Brain Emulation Part 3: Consciousness," we discussed how consciousness may be defined or measured, both from a 3rd person and 1st person perspective.

While consciousness is a critical property of a successful whole brain emulation, the property that raises the most questions, debate and controversy in the context of achieving a successful outcome for mind uploading through whole brain emulation is personal identity. What is personal identity? How can you confirm a person’s identity, taking into consideration both 1st and 3rd person perspectives? How is personal identity affected by proposed physical processes to achieve mind uploading through whole brain emulation?

In this upcoming Winter 2020 Workshop Event, we will examine these questions with the help of domain experts. As previously, we will present recorded interviews that are followed by a live panel discussion. Our moderator will include questions from the general public directly in the live discussion. This is your opportunity to ask about surviving mind uploading and to hone in on the details that matter.

The live workshop event will be held on Sunday, March 15, 2020 8AM PST / 11AM EST / 3PM GMT, presented globally through the Carboncopies Foundation YouTube Channel [https://carboncopies.org/livestream](https://carboncopies.org/livestream). We hope to see you there!
