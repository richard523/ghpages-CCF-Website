# Consciousness and Subjective Experience journal club

This is a collaborative biweekly engagement involving primarily members of the Carboncopies Foundation
and of the Brain Preservation Foundation. We are primarily discussing papers and books that
cumulatively give us a good understanding of the state of the field, and that ultimately
enable us to connect experimental and reductionist approaches to theories of consciousness and
its neural correlates with approaches that begin with the structure of subjective phenomenology.
We include specific attention to all aspects of what Chalmers has dubbed the "hard problem" of
consciousness.

Ultimately, we aim for insights gained to coalesce into what we may consider a satisfying
and defensible model of consciousness and subjective experience that aligns with and informs
foundational core assumptions with regards to whole brain emulation.

Furthermore, insights into the requirements for subjective experience, being able to distinguish types of
intelligent processing that have conscious subjective experiences from those that probably
cannot, implications for the needs of well-being versus the risks of suffering, and attribution
of personhood will inform work in our WBE Ethics Framework project.
