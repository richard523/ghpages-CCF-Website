## Carboncopies Foundation Workshop, June 2021
### C-ELEGANS
#### The First Emulation?

![C.Elegans Workshop](Assets/Promo_Image_C-Elegans_June_2021.png)

The nematode C. Elegans is a primary subject for neural connectome mapping and experimentation because of its connectome features.

It is a good way to study methods to scan and model. This is because it is a simple organism with a tiny connectome of 302 neurons always connected in the same way.

In this workshop we will discuss the implications of C. Elegans research including the current C. Elegans modeling challenges, current connectomic mapping and modeling advances, and counter arguments against C. Elegans being an effective precursor to human connectome research.
