## Assistant Project Manager

**Assistant Project Manager**  
Carboncopies Foundation

**About Carboncopies Foundation**

The Carboncopies Foundation is an international nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing the science and technology of whole brain emulation—the process of transferring the structure and functions of a brain from its original biological substrate to an engineered computational one. Founded by neuroscientists and technologists, we serve as a nexus for research collaboration, education, and public discourse on the path toward preserving and extending human cognition.

Our initiatives span disciplines including neuroscience, computer science, neuroengineering, artificial intelligence, and philosophy. Through workshops, webinars, publications, and community coordination, we bring together researchers, students, and visionaries who share our mission. We believe that whole brain emulation is not only a grand scientific challenge, but a transformative opportunity for the future of human experience and identity.

With over 15 years of history in the field, our team continues to foster innovative research and interdisciplinary collaboration. Our projects are powered by a dedicated community of volunteers—over 100 have contributed to date, with more than 30 actively engaged today.
