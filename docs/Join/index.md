## Success Stories:

- ### Thomas Liao <br/> <h5> I'm particularly interested in computational neuroscience and distributed systems, so I started the BrainGenix project at the Carboncopies Foundation. At BrainGenix, we're trying to develop a platform that will eventually lead to Whole Brain Emulation. I love technology - from code and servers to trains and urban planning. If any of that sounds interesting to you, head on over to check out some of my [projects](https://tliao.net)!</h5> ![](https://tliao.net/assets/Portrait.jpg-c.jpg) ![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/scl/fi/e4lsm8qz5v13gooxy7xth/msedge_o7YOiuCGTc.jpg?rlkey=ni133vwtt8wbdt5if4zcctbua&dl=0)



- ### Angela Thornton <br/> <h5> In 2018 I fulfilled a long-held dream of returning to academia and completed a MSc in Psychological Research Methods at the University of Nottingham (UoN) where I gained a distinction. I chose this course as a stepping stone to a fully funded PhD at Horizon Centre of Doctoral Training – also based at the UoN – and started my PhD journey in 2019. My thesis looks to explore the personal and public narrative around the hypothetical journey to Whole Brain Emulation and the ultimate creation of a Substrate Independent Mind. </h5> ![](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/PressReleaseLongForm-Images/Engineering/2023/Angela-Thornton-BSF-Award/Angela-Thornton-cropped.x031bfb92.jpg)

- ### Poonam Shokeen <br/> <h5> Working at Carboncopies Foundation has been transformative. As a Program Manager, I gained leadership skills, adaptability, and invaluable growth. Dr. Randal and the supportive team pushed me to excel. Collaborating with brilliant minds and cutting-edge technology shaped my career and perspective. Grateful for this incredible journey! </h5> ![](https://i.imgur.com/yo6mJVg.jpeg)


- ### Richard Gatchalian <br/> <h5> I'm a recent Software Engineering graduate from UT Dallas, bringing a sharp focus on modern web technologies and AI-driven solutions to the Carboncopies Foundation. Specializing in large language models and SEO-optimized tech stacks like NextJS and mkdocs, I'm adept at architecting scalable web applications and streamlining development workflows. My passion lies in leveraging cutting-edge tools to build efficient, user-friendly systems, contributing to the foundation's mission of advancing research in mind uploading and related fields. </h5> ![](https://i.imgur.com/xQoLA1q.png)
