## Complex systems

**Complex Systems Research Volunteer**  
Carboncopies Foundation

**About Carboncopies Foundation**

The Carboncopies Foundation is an international nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing the science and technology of whole brain emulation \- the process of transferring the structure and functions of a brain from its original substrate to another computational substrate of a neural prosthesis. Founded by neuroscientists and technologists, we serve as a nexus for research collaboration, education, and public discourse on the path toward preserving and extending human cognition.

Our work spans multiple disciplines including neuroscience, computer science, nanotechnology, and philosophy. Through workshops, webinars, publications, and community building, we bring together researchers, students, and enthusiasts who share our vision of developing technologies that may one day allow for the precise mapping and functional recreation of neural architectures. We believe that whole brain emulation represents not only a profound scientific challenge but also a potential pathway to extending human experience, knowledge, and consciousness beyond current biological limitations.

For over 15 years, we have been at the forefront of research and development in this field, fostering collaboration between leading neuroscientists, technologists, and visionaries who share our mission. Our efforts have been powered by a dedicated communityâ€”over 100 volunteers have contributed to our initiatives over the years, with 30+ actively driving our programs forward today.

**Position Overview**

We're seeking a volunteer with expertise in complex systems, system identification, inverse problems, and/or applied mathematics to contribute to our research initiatives and technical projects.

**Key Responsibilities**:

* Analyze complex systems and develop mathematical models relevant to our research goals  
* Apply system identification techniques to extract patterns and relationships from data  
* Work on inverse problems to determine underlying parameters from observational data  
* Collaborate with our interdisciplinary team on research projects  
* Document methodologies and findings for both internal use and potential publication

**Qualifications**:

* (Working towards an) advanced degree (or equivalent experience) in applied mathematics, engineering, physics, computer science, or related field  
* Strong background in complex systems theory, system identification, and/or inverse problems  
* Experience with mathematical modeling and simulation  
* Proficiency in relevant computational tools and programming languages  
* Ability to explain complex technical concepts to diverse audiences  
* Self-motivated with ability to work independently and collaboratively  
* Interest in brain science, neural technologies, or whole brain emulation is a plus


**Time Commitment**  
Approximately 5-10 hours per week, with flexibility on scheduling.

**Benefits**:

* We are able to coordinate with university programs on carrying out a PhD in association with the Carboncopies Foundation.  
* We are able to coordinate with university programs on carrying out credit-earning student internships in association with the Carboncopies Foundation.  
* Contribute to cutting-edge research in an emerging field  
* Collaborate with other researchers and technical experts  
* Potential for co-authorship on publications  
* Expand your professional network in the neuroscience and technology communities  
* Attend our events and webinars at no cost  
* Letter of recommendation upon successful completion of 6 months of service

**How to Apply**  
If our mission resonates with you, we encourage you to get involved. To apply for a volunteer position, please send your resume and a brief statement outlining your interest to onboarding@carboncopies.org with "Complex Systems Research Volunteer" in the subject line.
