The Carboncopies Foundation is the only organization dedicated to the full extent
of the field, from its metaphysical presuppositions and implications, through
data collection technologies, to neuronal modeling and system functionalization,
ethical considerations, and the world-wide network of leading experts and
institutions involved. We have been doing this since 2010 and our researchers
have scientific and technical qualifications and insight focused on all aspects
of whole brain emulation.

As a 501\(c)(3) non-profit education and research foundation, our mission demands
that we fully support any and all efforts to advance the field and to achieve
whole brain emulation. We are happy to work with you to fully evaluate
concepts, proposals, teams and pitches to achieve unbiased, scientifically
competent and confidential insight.

In many cases, these services are provided free of charge, as part of our
research and education mission.

**We welcome your due diligence inquiries**. Reach out to us through contact@carboncopies.org.
