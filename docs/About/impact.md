# Making an impact with the Carboncopies Foundation

The following lists an excerpt of our activities over the years, demonstrating some of
the different ways in which the Carboncopies Foundation strives to make a positive
impact on the development of whole brain emulation and on its outcomes.

## The Brain Emulation Challenge

An ongoing project of Carboncopies Research, our Bain Emulation Challenge is taking
on the principal hurdle standing in the way of actual end-to-end examples of
brain emulation: The translation from brain data to working dynamic systems that
are verifiably correct.

## Research projects at the CCF

An overview of currently active research projects at the Carboncopies Foundation,
giving insight into the way the Foundation chooses its targets for direct research
involvement by identifying key gaps in need of being addressed or incentivized.

And participation in cutting edge science:

- [Fast imaging of millimeter-scale areas with beam deflection transmission electron microscopy](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.23.517701v1).

## Our goals and what we do

Our About page strives to explain our effort to ensure beneficial outcomes and a
positive impact on the world, as well as our methods, such as when it becomes
clear that direct Carboncopies activities in research are appropriate and
necessary.

## Educating about whole brain emulation

[A mini-course on whole brain emulation](https://mindamyers.notion.site/Mini-Course-on-Whole-Brain-Emulation-WBE-d832a48974c5476c9d021cdf0c715bb4).

Various talks given at institutions and events, such as:

- [Whole brain emulation, reverse engineering a mind (a detailing)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjrVIHZZG0&t=1213s)

And foundational publications:

- [Fundamentals of Whole Brain Emulation: State, Transition and Update Representations](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S179384301240001X).

## Collecting expert insights

Our events gather experts in domains critical for whole brain emulation. For example:

- Roadmap workshop: [Consciousness, with Christof Koch, Michael Graziano and others](https://carboncopies.org/Events/Workshops/Topic/UpdatingRoadmap/Part3/).
- Roadmap workshop: [Patient specific selection, fitting and verification](https://carboncopies.org/Events/Workshops/Topic/UpdatingRoadmap/Part6/).
