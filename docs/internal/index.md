# Team Information - Internal

**Dear Carboncopies Team!**

This page is the top page for useful (but not critically secret) information intended for
Carboncopies Team members. We hope this is useful, but please let us know about possible
improvements and any information you think should be added here. *You can message us about
it in the ["Carboncopies Core Team" Google Space channel](https://chat.google.com/room/AAAA1jCxkNI?cls=7).*

## Carboncopies Connect

**Carboncopies Connect** is both our newsletter and a repository for whole brain emulation
related news, fun facts, helpful hints and tips for new team members, new papers or
blog articles, new videos and other media worth knowing about, accomplishments within
CCF projects, and more.

As a CCF team member we would like you to think of Carboncopies Connect as a "habit",
something that comes to mind immediately when you encouter or achieve anything that
you think other people at Carboncopies (or our newsletter readers) would be interested
in.

*Did you just finish something that contributes to our mission? Did you just make
or come across something cool? Go ahead to the page linked here and use the embedded
form to send it to Carboncopies Connect for editing and inclusion in a future issue
of the Carboncopies Connect newsletter, on our social media, or in our video
channels.*
