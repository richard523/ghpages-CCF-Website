# Send to Carboncopies Connect

**Carboncopies Connect** is both our newsletter and a repository for whole brain emulation
related news, fun facts, helpful hints and tips for new team members, new papers or
blog articles, new videos and other media worth knowing about, accomplishments within
CCF projects, and more.

As a CCF team member we would like you to think of Carboncopies Connect as a "habit",
something that comes to mind immediately when you encouter or achieve anything that
you think other people at Carboncopies (or our newsletter readers) would be interested
in.
