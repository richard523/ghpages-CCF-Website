# Carboncopies Foundation Newsletter: July-August, 2024

*Read Length 4~ minutes*

Welcome to the second edition of the CarbonCopies Newsletter! For this edition we would like to highlight our progress made towards the [Virtual Brain Platform Challenge](https://videos.carboncopies.org/view?m=yY1QRzTQA) and also our Micro-Workshop held on 8/4/2024.

## BrainGenix / VBP updates:

In the past two months our developers have focused on integrating the Netmorph Platform (Netmorph is a software that stimulates neuronal growth, to generate biologically plausible neurons) into the Virtual Brain Platform challenge. We focused on integrating [Netmorph](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19672726/) because it is one of key checkboxes leading up to the launch of the challenge. You will be pleased to know that progress is moving at a swift pace.

We would like to thank all of the attendees of our "Micro-Workshop". During the workshop Dr. Koene discussed in detail the Virtual Brain Platform Challange, and held an insightful Q&A session at the end. If you would like to view a recording of the micro-workshop [Click Here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq-MZDTozKU)

## Creation of the CarbonCopies Foundation Discord Server!

Just this month we revitalized our server and it is now an area of discussion for all things neuroscience and whole brain emulation! Everyone is completely free to join and we you all [Here](https://discord.gg/quqzV4P4Z4), We hope to see you there!
