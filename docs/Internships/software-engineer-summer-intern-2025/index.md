## C++ Software Engineering Summer 2025 Internship  Carboncopies Foundation

**About Carboncopies Foundation**

The Carboncopies Foundation is an international nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing the science and technology of whole brain emulation \- the process of transferring the structure and functions of a brain from its original substrate to another computational substrate of a neural prosthesis. Founded by neuroscientists and technologists, we serve as a nexus for research collaboration, education, and public discourse on the path toward preserving and extending human cognition.

Our work spans multiple disciplines including neuroscience, computer science, nanotechnology, and philosophy. Through workshops, webinars, publications, and community building, we bring together researchers, students, and enthusiasts who share our vision of developing technologies that may one day allow for the precise mapping and functional recreation of neural architectures. We believe that whole brain emulation represents not only a profound scientific challenge but also a potential pathway to extending human experience, knowledge, and consciousness beyond current biological limitations.

For over 15 years, we have been at the forefront of research and development in this field, fostering collaboration between leading neuroscientists, technologists, and visionaries who share our mission. Our efforts have been powered by a dedicated communityâ€”over 100 volunteers have contributed to our initiatives over the years, with 30+ actively driving our programs forward today.
