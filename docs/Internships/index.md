## Interested In Joining Carboncopies?

The volunteers who donate their time are the driving force of the Carboncopies Foundation. We are always looking for more people to join our team – and you don't need to have an advanced degree to make an important contribution.

There are plenty of ways that anyone can pitch in, so if you want to be involved in helping to make Whole Brain Emulation a reality, let us know at [onboarding@carboncopies.org](mailto:onboarding@carboncopies.org).


## Thank you to our past interns:

- ### Syed Islam <br/> <h5> I've made the **BrainGenix Python client** easier to use by combining an older part of the code into the main program. This means all the scripts still work, and it's simpler for developers. I also built a new feature that lets researchers get a detailed map of the brain's connections, showing exactly where each neuron and its connections are located.<br/><br/>I am a recent CS graduate from UCR and am continuing my education at UT Austin in AI. I plan to do more Research into Machine Learning focusing on Deep Networks.</h5> ![](https://i.imgur.com/oJWXFZ1.jpeg)

- ### Trisha Mendoza <br/> <h5> My name is Trisha Mendoza, and I served as a lead for the Carboncopies data science intern group. During my time at Carboncopies, I conducted an in-depth literature review on common methods for testing and validating neuronal models to support the Whole Brain Emulation Challenge. As part of this work, I researched and developed a metrics library designed to evaluate the performance of user models against ground truth data.<br/><br/>I am now entering my final year of graduate school at the University of California, Irvine, where my research focuses on computational neuroscience. Specifically, I study and identify biomarkers of seizure-generating regions in patients with refractory epilepsy. After graduating in June 2026, I hope to continue advancing research in computational neuroscience.</h5> ![](https://i.imgur.com/jgHaajq.jpeg)

- ### Vilohith Gokarakonda <br/> <h5> My internship work is about finding the inverse problem for whole brain emulation, which is about challenges neuroscientist might face when trying to emulate brain activities in a mathematical sense. This deals with concepts like regulaization methods, numerical stability, mathematical modeling, scale seperation, etc. The research I worked the most on was creating emulations of a neuron model with different conditions and parameters and comparing them to the ground truth.<br/><br/>My name is Vilohith Gokarakonda and I am a 3rd Year Undergraduate at Georgia Tech, majoring in Computer Science and Minoring in Mathematics. My interests lie in mathematical modeling and scientific machine learning. I love to play sports like badminton, tennis, and chess.</h5> ![](https://i.imgur.com/boE7RCw.jpeg)

- ### Soyeon Kim <br/> <h5> I developed a full-adder model using the LIFC model by carefully timing and adjusting the weights of each neuronal connection. During this process, I implemented a simplified version of XOR gate logic (hence reducing the total number of neurons). I also modified the structure of the LIFC model in my implementation of full-adder circuit to make adding neurons easier.<br/><br/>My name is Soyeon Kim and I’m currently studying Computer Science with a minor of Art & Design at The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I love exploring AR/VR and anything visual within the field of computer science. I’m also a freelance photographer on campus!</h5> ![](https://i.imgur.com/rHV5Ebd.jpeg)

- ### Aiden Behler <br/> <h5> During the internship, we developed an integrate and fire neuron network interface to collect simulated data. We created a list of statistical metrics that can be used as a grading criterion for the Whole Brain Emulation challenge. And, we created a test suite using the metrics to generate a user report based on the comparison of two simulated neuron network models.<br/><br/>I am a student in college studying computer science. I have a strong interest in computational neuroscience and brain computer interface technology. My goal is to help work on technologies that will change the world some day.</h5> ![](https://i.imgur.com/uHctRJV.jpeg)
