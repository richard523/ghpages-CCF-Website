## DataScience  Engineering Summer 2025 Internship  Carboncopies Foundation

**About Carboncopies Foundation**

The Carboncopies Foundation is an international nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing the science and technology of whole brain emulation \- the process of transferring the structure and functions of a brain from its original substrate to another computational substrate of a neural prosthesis. Founded by neuroscientists and technologists, we serve as a nexus for research collaboration, education, and public discourse on the path toward preserving and extending human cognition.

Our work spans multiple disciplines including neuroscience, computer science, nanotechnology, and philosophy. Through workshops, webinars, publications, and community building, we bring together researchers, students, and enthusiasts who share our vision of developing technologies that may one day allow for the precise mapping and functional recreation of neural architectures. We believe that whole brain emulation represents not only a profound scientific challenge but also a potential pathway to extending human experience, knowledge, and consciousness beyond current biological limitations.

For over 15 years, we have been at the forefront of research and development in this field, fostering collaboration between leading neuroscientists, technologists, and visionaries who share our mission. Our efforts have been powered by a dedicated communityâ€”over 100 volunteers have contributed to our initiatives over the years, with 30+ actively driving our programs forward today.

**Position Overview**

We are seeking a highly motivated, self-directed **Data Science Intern** to join our research team. This role will focus on analyzing electrophysiology data from neurons and developing quantitative metrics to evaluate and compare signal processing performance between a ground-truth system and its reconstructed counterpart. The ideal candidate has a passion for data-driven research and an interest in neuroscience and neural technologies. 

**Key Responsibilities**:

* Analyze and interpret electrophysiological data to identify patterns and insights
* Design and implement metrics for comparing ground-truth neural signals with reconstructed data
* Build and maintain data pipelines for handling complex and large-scale datasets
* Contribute to feature development and functionality based on evolving project needs
* Document code and maintain high-quality technical documentation
* Collaborate with researchers and technical volunteers to align on goals and implementation
* Participate in code reviews and assist with testing
* Contribute to academic papers and potentially serve as a co-author


**Qualifications**:

* Currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Statistics, Mathematics, Neuroscience, or a related quantitative field
* Strong proficiency in Python and experience with data science libraries (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn); familiarity with R and/or SQL is a plus
* Experience working with version control tools such as Git
* Demonstrated ability to analyze, manipulate, and model complex datasets
* Understanding of statistical models and comfort working in data-rich environments
* Excellent communication skills for presenting findings to both technical and non-technical audiences
* Strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail
* Ability to work independently with minimal supervision
* Interest in neuroscience, brain-machine interfaces, or whole brain emulation is highly desirable


**Time Commitment**  
Approximately 20 \- 40  hours per week, with flexibility on scheduling.

**Benefits**:

* Build a portfolio of work in a collaborative environment  
* We are able to coordinate with university programs on carrying out credit-earning student internships in association with the Carboncopies Foundation.  
* Contribute to cutting-edge research in an emerging field  
* Collaborate with other developers and researchers  
* Potential for co-authorship on publications  
* Expand your professional network in the neuroscience and technology communities  
* Attend our events and webinars at no cost
