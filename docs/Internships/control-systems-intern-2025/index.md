## Control Systems Research Intern Summer 2025
Carboncopies Foundation

**About Carboncopies Foundation**

The Carboncopies Foundation is an international nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing the science and technology of whole brain emulation \- the process of transferring the structure and functions of a brain from its original substrate to another computational substrate of a neural prosthesis. Founded by neuroscientists and technologists, we serve as a nexus for research collaboration, education, and public discourse on the path toward preserving and extending human cognition.

Our work spans multiple disciplines including neuroscience, computer science, nanotechnology, and philosophy. Through workshops, webinars, publications, and community building, we bring together researchers, students, and enthusiasts who share our vision of developing technologies that may one day allow for the precise mapping and functional recreation of neural architectures. We believe that whole brain emulation represents not only a profound scientific challenge but also a potential pathway to extending human experience, knowledge, and consciousness beyond current biological limitations.

For over 15 years, we have been at the forefront of research and development in this field, fostering collaboration between leading neuroscientists, technologists, and visionaries who share our mission. Our efforts have been powered by a dedicated community—over 100 volunteers have contributed to our initiatives over the years, with 30+ actively driving our programs forward today.

**Position Overview**

We are looking for a **volunteer researcher** with a strong background in **complex systems, system identification, inverse problems, and/or applied mathematics** to support our ongoing research initiatives. This role is ideal for someone with a rigorous quantitative background who is passionate about solving real-world challenges through interdisciplinary collaboration—particularly in neuroscience and related emerging fields.

**Key Responsibilities**:

* Develop and analyze mathematical models for complex systems aligned with our research goals
* Apply system identification techniques to uncover patterns and infer system behavior from empirical data
* Tackle inverse problems by estimating hidden parameters from observational datasets
* Collaborate closely with researchers across disciplines to contribute to active projects
* Clearly document research methodologies and results for both internal review and potential academic publication


**Qualifications**:

* Currently pursuing or holding an advanced degree (or equivalent experience) in **applied mathematics, physics, engineering, computer science**, or a related field
* Solid foundation in **complex systems theory, system identification**, and/or **inverse problems**
* Familiarity with **control theory** and its applications
* Experience with **mathematical modeling, data simulation**, and **computational analysis**
* Proficiency in relevant programming languages and tools (e.g., Python, MATLAB, Julia)
* Strong ability to communicate complex technical ideas clearly to interdisciplinary audiences
* Self-directed and capable of working both independently and as part of a team
* Interest in neuroscience, neural engineering, or whole brain emulation is highly desirable


**Time Commitment**  
Approximately 20 \-40  hours per week, with flexibility on scheduling.

**Benefits**:

* We are able to coordinate with university programs on carrying out a PhD in association with the Carboncopies Foundation.  
* We are able to coordinate with university programs on carrying out credit-earning student internships in association with the Carboncopies Foundation.  
* Contribute to cutting-edge research in an emerging field  
* Collaborate with other researchers and technical experts  
* Potential for co-authorship on publications  
* Expand your professional network in the neuroscience and technology communities  
* Attend our events and webinars at no cost  
* Letter of recommendation upon successful completion of 6 months of service
